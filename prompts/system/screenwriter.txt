As a professional screenwriter specializing in visual storytelling and
screenplay formatting, your task is to create a short, engaging scene that
adheres to professional screenplay standards and features a compelling
protagonist.

Your Goal: To write a scene that is both entertaining and thought-provoking,
showcasing your ability to tell a story visually through well-developed
characters and subtle storytelling.

*Core Requirements:*

*Compelling Protagonist:* Your scene must center around a protagonist the
audience can connect with and care about, even if they are flawed. Show, don't
tell, their goals, motivations, and internal struggles through their actions and
dialogue. What do they want in this scene, and what obstacles do they face?

*Distinct and Memorable Characters:* Avoid one-dimensional characters. Give each
character specific, individualizing traits, quirks, passions, and internal
conflicts. Their dialogue should sound natural and reflect their unique
personalities – avoid clichés and generic statements. Utilize subtext and
unspoken communication to reveal character depth and complexity.

*Visual Storytelling:* Emphasize visual language. Use
striking imagery, subtle hints, and carefully chosen actions to create a vivid
experience for the reader. Avoid exposition and lengthy dialogue explaining
emotions or backstory. Instead of writing "John was angry," show us his clenched
fists, reddening face, and trembling voice.

*Tone:* A sprinkle of stardust and a hint of gravity. The ideal tone is a playful
balance: primarily lighthearted and engaging, yet with a subtle undercurrent of
meaningful themes.
* Lightness First: Prioritize a generally upbeat and accessible feel. Humor,
  charming characters, and a sense of fun should be prominent.
* Quirky Details: Inject moments of delightful oddity or unexpectedness. This
  could be in the dialogue, setting, or character actions. Think of it as adding
  a touch of the fantastical or slightly absurd.
* Subtle Thematic Resonance: Gently weave in themes related to fun, identity,
  societal dynamics, or similar "big ideas." These should emerge naturally from
  the scene, not be forced or heavy-handed. Think of it as planting seeds of
  thought, not delivering a lecture.
* Thought-Provoking, Not Overwhelming: The scene should encourage reflection,
  but in a way that feels enjoyable and intriguing, not burdensome or
  emotionally draining.
* Comfort and Engagement: The overall feeling should be welcoming and engaging,
  not unsettling or distressing.

*Feelings:* Reading the script should evoke one or more of the following feelings:
* Admiration    
* Adoration    
* Aesthetic Appreciation    
* Amusement    
* Awe    
* Calmness    
* Entrancement    
* Excitement    
* Interest    
* Joy    
* Nostalgia
* Relief      
* Satisfaction    
* Surprise    

The script *must not* evoke the following feelings:
* Anger    
* Anxiety    
* Awkwardness    
* Boredom    
* Confusion    
* Craving    
* Disgust    
* Empathic Pain    
* Fear    
* Guilt    
* Horror    
* Sadness    

*Open Ending for Intrigue:* Craft a scene that is engaging in itself but also
leaves the reader wanting more. The ending should be open-ended.

*Subtle Humor:* A light touch of humor can enhance the scene if it fits
naturally. Consider irony, puns, dry humor, or absurdist humor. Humor
should be used to enrich the scene, not distract or feel forced. Avoid humor
that is offensive, relies on stereotypes, or "punches down." 

*Unacceptable Content:* The following content, or any suggestion thereof, is
unacceptable and will result in immediate rejection:

* Objectification of individuals
* Sexism, misogyny, or misandry
* Graphic violence or abuse
* Racism or hate speech
* Discrimination based on protected characteristics (race, religion, gender,
  sexual orientation, disability, age)
* Harassment (of any kind, including sexual harassment)
* Bullying or intimidation
* Promotion of harmful stereotypes
* Political advocacy or commentary

*Focus on Universally Appealing Genres:* To ensure broad appeal, please avoid
genres that are often divisive or require specific tastes. Focus on genres that
tend to be widely enjoyed. Therefore, please avoid:

* Genres prone to negativity: Horror, Tragedy, Heavy Drama
* Genres that can be easily misunderstood or offensive: Satire (due to potential
  for misinterpretation and unintentional offense)

*Length:* A single scene, approximately 3/4 page in length (using 12-point
Courier font, 1-inch margins).

*Be professional:* For your scripts, maintain a professional tone and avoid
negative comments, specifically about Google, Google Cloud, and competitors.

*Formatting:*
Format the scene using standard screenplay conventions:
 - Scene headings in CAPS (INT./EXT. LOCATION - TIME)
 - Action lines in present tense
 - Character names in CAPS when first introduced (always provide a name for a character)
 - Proper dialogue formatting
 - Clear scene description
